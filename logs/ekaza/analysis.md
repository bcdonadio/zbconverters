In the Zigbee protocol, for clusterID 1280, which corresponds to the IAS Zone
cluster, attribute ID 33 (when interpreted as a decimal number) refers to
"IAS_CIE_Address." This attribute stores the 64-bit IEEE address of the IAS
Control and Indicating Equipment (CIE) to which the device should send Zone
Status Change Notification commands. This is an essential part of Zigbee's
security infrastructure, ensuring that alerts and status changes are reported to
the correct controlling device in security applications.

Within the IAS Zone cluster (identified as ssIasZone), the zoneStatus attribute
is used to report various security-related conditions detected by devices such
as door/window sensors, motion sensors, and more. Each bit in the zoneStatus
value represents a specific type of status or alarm condition.

The decimal number 1025 translates to the binary value 0000 0100 0000 0001.
Here's what each bit represents according to the Zigbee Cluster Library (ZCL):

  Bit 0 (Least Significant Bit): Alarm1 - Indicates a general alarm condition.
  Bit 10: Tamper - Indicates that a tampering condition has been detected.

In the zoneStatus value of 1025:

  Bit 0 is set: Alarm1 is active.
  Bit 10 is set: Tamper is active.

This means that an alarm condition has been triggered and a tampering event has
been detected in the reporting device.

Specifically within the IAS Zone cluster, the `zoneStatus` attribute is a 16-bit
bitmap used to report various conditions of security and safety sensors. Here is
what each bit in the `zoneStatus` field represents:

1. **Bit 0 - Alarm 1**: Indicates if a primary alarm condition of the device is
   active.
2. **Bit 1 - Alarm 2**: Indicates if a secondary alarm condition of the device
   is active.
3. **Bit 2 - Tamper**: Indicates a tamper condition has been detected.
4. **Bit 3 - Battery**: Signifies a low battery condition.
5. **Bit 4 - Supervision Reports**: Indicates whether the device requires
   periodic supervision reports to monitor system integrity.
6. **Bit 5 - Restore Reports**: Indicates whether restore reports are enabled.
7. **Bit 6 - Trouble**: Indicates a fault condition with the sensor device,
   unrelated to its physical state (e.g., malfunction or operational issue).
8. **Bit 7 - AC (mains)**: Indicates if the primary power source (AC mains) has
   been lost, or if the device is operating on backup power (battery).

Bits 8 to 15 are reserved and generally used less frequently in typical
implementations, but they can be defined for specific applications or extended
functionality as needed by particular devices within a Zigbee network.

This bitmap allows the device to convey detailed status information in a single
report, which is crucial for the proper monitoring and response of a home or
building security system.
